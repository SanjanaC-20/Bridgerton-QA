Bridgerton QA is a web-based question answering system that is trained on 
**Bridgerton – Book 3 by Julia Quinn**.  
The website is designed to answer **any question related to the book** by retrieving relevant content from the text and generating accurate responses.

The objective of this project is to build a domain-specific Question Answering system that:
- Uses *Bridgerton Book 3* as its only knowledge source
- Answers user queries strictly based on the book
- Avoids generating information outside the provided content

Full book text is excluded due to copyright.
